# Welcome to Hibernate Spatial
            
Hibernate Spatial is a generic extension to Hibernate for handling geographic data. Hibernate Spatial is open source and licensed, like Hibernate, under the LGPL license.

Hibernate Spatial allows you to deal with geographic data in a standardized 	way. It abstracts away from the specific way your database supports geographic data, and provides
a standardized, cross-database interface to geographic data storage and query functions.

Hibernate Spatial supports most of the functions of the OGC Simple Feature Specification. Supporteddatabases are: Oracle 10g/11g, Postgresql/Postgis, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and H2/GeoDB.

There is a similar project for NHibernate: [NHibernate.Spatial](http://nhforge.org/wikis/spatial/default.aspx")
